# Investment calculator

## ðŸ“‹ Description
The investment Calculator was built with the finality of practicing some basic skills of React and that was proposed by a course of the [React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) in your fifth section. That's a simple project, where with:
  - Initial investment
  - Annual investment
  - Expected return
  - Duration
    
you will see a table where you can consult information like:
  - Investment value
  - Interest (Year)
  - Total interest
  - Invested capital
    
all of them will be updated in real-time always that you change the input information.
